                            In this modern world of development and technology, the art of starting development and the way of continuously doing it is something
                            very challenging. There are various obstacles that one needs to face and therefore perfect planning and proper guidance can
                            lead to better understanding and help in reaching greater heights.<br /><br />

                            This challenge motivated us to come up with this <b>One Day International Webinar</b> where the Industry Experts will share their knowledge and experience
                            on how to become a successful developer and what can be the various paths or roadmaps that one can follow.
                            Along with the intense talk from experts we will also have an amazing Hand-on session on "How to Deploy your Project", which will be
                            delivered by our Developer Lead.
